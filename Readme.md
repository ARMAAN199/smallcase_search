# News Keyword Search Application

Enter a Keyword to search for news articles from different sources related to that query in the recent days.

## Objectives

> Waiting for user to stop typing and prevent sending requests on intermediate states.

```JavaScript
          clearTimeout(this.timer);
          const newTimer = setTimeout(() => {
            this.checkCacheOrFetch(currentinput);
          }, 1000);
          this.setState({ ...this.state, timer: newTimer, errmsg: "" });
```

We do not call the fetch function untill it's been a second since user pressed a key.

> Not allowing any requests for serach quueries shorter than two characters

```JavaScript
      this.setState({
        ...this.state,
        query: currentinput,
        loading: false,
        errmsg: "Search Query Should be atleast 3 Characters long",
        results: {},
        pageNo: 1,
      });
```

To run the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i` followed by `npm start`

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
